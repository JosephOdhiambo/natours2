In last section, JWT should be store in HTTPS cookie
We are currently storing our JWT string in our json response. Let's also set the token as 
our cookie.

In authcontroller in createSendToken is where we processed our JWT
Cookie: A small piece of text the server can send to clients. When the client received the cookie, 
It will automatically store it the automatically send it back along with ll future requests of the same server.
A browser automatically stores a cookie that it receives and sends it back in all future requests to that server where it came from.
It is not going to be as important to as as we are using postman. When rendering dynamic webpages, then it will become really important 
that the browser sends the token automatically in each request.

Creating and sending a cookie
We just detach it to the response object.
This functionality will not work in development since we are not using a browser. We set a condition such that secure is set to true


Let's test it by creating a new user(Sign up)
{
    "name": "User",
    "email": "user@jonas.uk",
    "password": "pass1234",
    "passwordConfirm": "pass1234",
    "role": "guide"
}

On postan, response is the same but we get one cookie. If you click on the cookie tab,
you will see the token stored under value column.
We also get the name, Expiration and HTTPOnly set to true, and secure set to false.
We can also see these details if we select cookies on the rightmost corner from body tab.

Now we want to get rid of the password therefore, in our schema we have to set select to false
so that it doesn't show up when we query for all the users but in this case, it comes from creating
a new document. That's different . That's why we set the user.password to undefined.
Let's go on to mongodb and delete the last created user and sign up again to see the changes.
{
    "name": "User",
    "email": "user@jonas.uk",
    "password": "pass1234",
    "passwordConfirm": "pass1234",
    "role": "guide"
}

{
    "status": "success",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYyOWYzMDhlY2NjMTM0MWFhNDMwYzQ1ZCIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDU5OTgyMywiZXhwIjoxNjYyMzc1ODIzfQ.SEsUWGnzmR1XflOLUVCz8gAnX7bOvHvMKOJaV2WqxhA",
    "data": {
        "user": {
            "role": "user",
            "active": true,
            "_id": "629f308eccc1341aa430c45d",
            "name": "User",
            "email": "user@jonas.uk",
            "__v": 0
        }
    }
}
As you can see, password field does not exist in this postman request.
We have a new cookie. This is because the old one has been overidden by the new one
and assigned to jwt on postman
